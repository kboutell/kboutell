I’m a recent Master’s graduate of the Applied Data Science for Business program at Portland State University, with a passion for turning complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive smarter decisions.

With a background in physics and experience in healthcare operations, I’ve developed dashboards, automated workflows, and improved reporting systems to enhance efficiency and collaboration. I’m proficient in Python, R, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. I enjoy bridging technical analysis with real-world business needs.

My recent capstone focused on generative AI adoption strategies, combining usage data, stakeholder interviews, and industry research to deliver actionable insights.

I’m especially interested in opportunities where I can contribute to data-driven transformation, whether through operations, analytics, or strategy. I'm seeking an early career analyst role on a collaborative, mission-driven team.
